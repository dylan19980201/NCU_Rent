# NCU rental reservation web

## Description

This is a project of our final project in Software Engineering at NCU. As the team leader, I was responsible for the system architecture and Full-stack development. We opted for JSP for frontend development, Java for backend, and MySQL for the database.

## Roles

According to the login users, they are categorized into three types: admin, landlord, and student. <br />
landlord: landlord are able to post his/her rental house. <br />
student: student have the ability to schedule appointments and provide feedback. <br />
admin: admin are responsible for reviewing and approving the rental listings submitted by landlords. <br />

## Example

This is an example of how an admin can approve rental listings (accessible only to users with the admin role) <br />
